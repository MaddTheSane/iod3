This is a fork of fabiensanglard's Doom 3 for Mac OS X ...fork :-P

It is modified to build properly under the latest Xcode and Mac OS X 10.7 SDK.

Currently there are some bugs (UI transition has been disabled because of a
linking issue with the templates - shouldn't be hard to fix, i just need some
time - and fullscreen modes are not support - again not hard, but...), but the
game is fully playable and performs fine under a late 2009 iMac with 9400M in
1024x768 with Ultra quality mode (it just takes a bit to load the textures, so
High or Medium quality should be better to avoid pauses).
